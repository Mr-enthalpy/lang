# lang

`lang` is an experimental programming language frontend.

The current repository target is **v0.1**.

## Current stage

```text
source text -> tokens -> AST -> diagnostics
```

v0.1 is a syntax frontend only. It lexes, parses, builds AST, and produces
diagnostics. It does not type-check, interpret, lower, or execute programs.

## Documentation map

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `spec/frontend-v0.1.md` | Reader entry point — explains the pipeline and spec organization |
| `spec/ast-construction-v0.1.md` | Normative AST construction rules — implement parser from this |
| `spec/diagnostics-v0.1.md` | Normative diagnostic categories, span policy, recovery |
| `spec/roadmap.md` | Stage model v0.1–v1.0 and scope boundaries |
| `spec/glossary.md` | Terminology definitions and critical distinctions |
| `spec/open-questions.md` | Unresolved design questions |
| `spec/README.md` | Spec index with authority levels |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent instructions — read before making code changes |
| `SKILL.md` | Operational workflow for frontend work |

Start with `spec/frontend-v0.1.md` to understand the pipeline, then
`spec/ast-construction-v0.1.md` to implement.

## Design summary

The language frontend is built around several early decisions.

### 1. Weak lexer

The lexer does not assign semantic roles to ordinary names.

Names such as:

```text
return else match drop move sync effect fn type meta runtime compile
```

are ordinary `Name` tokens.

Semantic strength does not imply lexical keyword status.

### 2. Contextual parser

Some names can act as structure delimiters only in strong parser contexts.

Examples:

- `let` at form start
- `where` in closure heads
- `acquire` in closure heads
- `guard` inside let bindings
- `with` inside let bindings

Outside their context, they remain ordinary names.

### 3. No traditional call syntax

The language does not use traditional:

```text
f(args)
```

as a general call form.

Parenthesized argument packs participate in the expression skeleton through
pipe and segment rules.

### 4. `|>` as expression skeleton

Expression construction is not based on a traditional operator-precedence table.

The expression frontend is organized as:

```text
atom folding
  -> top-level |> segmentation
  -> segment-local automatic pipe
  -> argpack role assignment
```

### 5. Closure literals produce AST first

A closure literal initially produces closure AST, not a callable object.

Examples:

```text
{}
() => {}
```

A later semantic pass may materialize closure AST into callable objects in
binding or call contexts.

Compiler meta-functions may directly consume closure AST.

### 6. `<>` declares holes

`<...>` has exactly one special use:

```text
declare names that act as holes in following syntax
```

It is only recognized in binding contexts.

It is not generic-call syntax, template syntax, or meta-function syntax.

### 7. Declarations enter through `let`

All user-visible declarations use `let`. There is no dedicated parser syntax for
function, type, namespace, or module declarations.

`fn`, `type`, and `namespace` are ordinary `Name` tokens, not lexer keywords.
v0.1 parses and preserves declaration annotations but does not check their
semantic validity.

```

## Build

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test
```



## CLI target

The `lang_cli` crate should eventually support:

```bash
lang tokens path/to/file.lang
lang ast path/to/file.lang
lang diag path/to/file.lang
```

The output format should be stable and suitable for golden tests.

Use a hand-written dump format rather than Rust `Debug` output.

## Non-goals for v0.1

Do not implement:

- type checking
- kind checking
- overload resolution
- canonical-form evaluation
- universal extraction matching
- closure AST materialization into callable objects
- match / effect / sync semantics
- ownership, lifetime, NLL, drop insertion
- interpretation
- code generation
- IR / HIR / MIR lowering
- parser generators (hand-written parser only)

The parser should preserve syntax sufficient for these future passes, but
must not perform them.

## How to read the spec

1. `spec/frontend-v0.1.md` — Understand the pipeline.
2. `spec/ast-construction-v0.1.md` — Implement the parser.
3. `spec/diagnostics-v0.1.md` — Understand error reporting.
4. `spec/glossary.md` — Resolve terminology.
5. `spec/roadmap.md` — Understand scope boundaries.
6. `spec/open-questions.md` — Recognize known gaps.

## Expected future workspace shape

Future stages may add crates under `crates/` such as:

```text
crates/
  lang_syntax/
  lang_cli/
  lang_typeck/       (v0.7+)
  lang_nll/          (v0.8+)
  lang_codegen/      (v1.0+)
```

No semantic crate should be added before its corresponding design stage.
